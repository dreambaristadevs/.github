We are a developer team dedicated to creating programmes that help people with lucid dreaming. Whether that means creating tools to assist on the development of projects from other developers or developing our own proprietary software, we only have one goal in mind and that is helping promote lucid dreaming awareness!

All of our work is open-source so feel free to fork, contribute and modify our projects. We try our best to always license our work under the `GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE` but different licenses can exist for different projects (so make sure to always double check under which license the project you want to use is).

If you want to join the team email us your Discord username and we'll contact you.
